## Reporting a Bug

Thank you for improving the security of IP Echo!

If you discover a security vulnerability in IP Echo, please disclose it by [drafting a security advisory on our GitHub](https://github.com/AverageHelper/ip-echo-cloudflare/security/advisories/new). (We have since moved primary operations to [git.average.name](https://git.average.name/AverageHelper/ip-echo-cloudflare), and are working on an alternative reporting site.) I do not currently have a way of paying out bounties for bugs. Enjoy the good vibes from knowing you're very helpful!

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.

## Comments on this Policy
